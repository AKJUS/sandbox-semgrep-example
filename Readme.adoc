= SecDim's Defensive Programming challenge
Python

== Objective

Find the security vulnerability and effectively fix it.

== Prerequisite

You should first complete *Start Here* level.

== Usage

* `make build` to build the container image
* `make run` to run the program: `http://localhost:8080`
* `make test` to run usability tests
* `make securitytest` to run security tests
* `make debug` to get a shell from the container and have `src` volume mapped to the container.
* `make push` to git add, commit and push
* `make status` to retrieve test output from the server

== Important notes

. Push only to `master` branch.
. You cannot install new dependencies. Solve the challenge using your own solution.
. Usability tests must always pass.
. All tests will be overwritten on the server.
